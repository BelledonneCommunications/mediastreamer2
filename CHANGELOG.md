## [Unreleased]


## [4.5.0] - 2021-03-29

### Added
- Audio route API to choose which device to use for capture & playback on Android & iOS.
- New camera capture backend based on Windows MediaFoundation 
- MSMediaPlayer enhancements.
- VideoConference API and engine prototype (active speaker switching only)


### Changed
- audio flow control algorithm improved, silent portions are dropped first.
- MKVPlayer supports seek in files without cue table.
- 'packetlosspercentage' is now configurable in opus encoder.

### Fixed
- misfunction in DTLS handshake over TURN
- fix arythmetic issue in clock skew computation, causing bad audio when the sound device outputs 
  audio fragments not multiple of 10ms.
- iOS AudioUnit configured with bad sample rate issue.
- wrong selection of ICE TURN candidates when the TURN server is behind a firewall
- unsent TURN SenderIndication packets on iOS
- fix video freeze in VP8, due to lack of retransmission of SLIs.
All these fix were backported to 4.4 branch.

## [4.4.0] - 2020-06-16

### Added
- TURN over TCP or TLS (previously was only UDP)
- Capture/playback gain control for Mac OS (AudioUnit)

### Changed
- Optimize mirroring for OpenGL based display filters. It was previously done in software.
- Make V4L2 capture filter work with read-only devices (such as with v4lloopback driver)

### Fixed
- ICE: set source IP addresses of outgoing packets consistent with the local candidate it is supposed to test or use.
  This fixes various ICE failures occuring when the host has multiple IP addresses (which is now common with IPv6)
- New implementation of MSEventQueue, to fix unreproductible crashes with the previous implementation.
- Crashes around mblk_t management of Video4Linux2 catpure filter.
- Random crash in VideoToolbox decoding filter.
- VP8 decoding errors due to an invalid aggregation of packets in rare circumstances
- Crash while reading mkv file with checksums.

### Added
- H265 codec based on MediaCodec API (Android only)
- H265 codec based on VideoToolbox API (iOS only)
- Adaptation of video resolution according to network capabilities.

### Changed
- License is now GNU GPLv3.
- For simplicity reasons, version number is aligned between all components of linphone-sdk.
