## [Unreleased]

## [4.4.0] - 2020-06-03

### Added
- TURN over TCP or TLS (previously was only UDP)
- Capture/playback gain control for Mac OS (AudioUnit)

### Changed
- Optimize mirroring for OpenGL based display filters. It was previously done in software.
- Make V4L2 capture filter work with read-only devices (such as with v4lloopback driver)
- iOS AudioUnit filter simplifications

### Fixed
- ICE: set source IP addresses of outgoing packets consistent with the local candidate it is supposed to test or use.
  This fixes various ICE failures occuring when the host has multiple IP addresses (which is now common with IPv6)
- New implementation of MSEventQueue, to fix unreproductible crashes with the previous implementation.
- Crashes around mblk_t management of Video4Linux2 catpure filter.
- Random crash in VideoToolbox decoding filter.
- VP8 decoding errors due to an invalid aggregation of packets in rare circumstances
- Crash while reading mkv file with checksums.
